# Machine-learning-model-future-sales

This Task involves modeling attached data, conducting exploratory analysis, and proposing/implementing a machine learning (ML) model for future sales. You'll be evaluated on data engineering, exploratory data analysis/business intelligence, and data science skills. Your focus will be on identifying facts and dimensions, building a functional data model in Apache Spark using PySpark. This includes proposing a relational data model (e.g., star schema), installing Spark and PySpark on Google Colab, verifying data schema, creating fact/dimension tables, and using PySpark to enrich data and handle missing values. You'll explore the data using PySpark and a Python plotting library, visualizing patterns/trends and conducting queries on the data model. Additionally, you'll build a suitable Python ML model to predict future sales quantities, presenting validation metrics and plots. Your submission should include a Google Colab link for results and a Google Drive link for the data model diagram.
